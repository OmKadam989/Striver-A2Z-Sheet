# 🚀 DSA Practice Hub

Welcome to my **DSA Repository**.  
This repo documents my journey of mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms** through problem-solving, mainly following **[Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2/)**.  

Each problem includes:
- ✅ Multiple Approaches (Brute Force → Optimal)  
- ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity Analysis  
- 🔗 Problem Link (LeetCode/GFG)  

---

## ✨ Why This Repo?
- Covers every problem from Striver’s A2Z sheet.  
- Easy navigation with problem links.  
- Track different approaches at one place.  
- Clean and professional for quick revision.
